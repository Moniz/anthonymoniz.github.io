Hello! I'm Anthony Moniz. A Game Programmer in the industry for 10 years.
The main goal of this blog is to share knowledge I wish I had when I started in the industry, as well as common topics I find myself sharing with new programmers when they enter the industry.

Website was made with Jekyll, using the Minima theme.

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
